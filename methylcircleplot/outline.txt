I/O
One element:
Read from file
-nonexsist -> stop
-empty -> interactive then stop
Read from folder
-non-exist -> stop
-empty -> interactive then stop
No elements:
Read from console (interactive)
-empty -> stop
Else:
Read from R input (vector)

Input handling (uppercase and remove spaces/newlines)
ref.seq
-vector length != 1 -> stop
-non-ACTGN -> warning
primer (fwd/rev)
-vector length != 1 -> stop
-non-ACTGN -> warning
bis.seq
-non-ACTGN -> stop if 10%+ else warning
primers
-NULL -> change to ""
-only one is "" -> message

Primers in reference
fwd found only
-match start of reference 90%+ -> search for reverse compelement of reverse primer -> warning
rev found only
-match end of reference 90%+ -> warning
both found
-match extremes of reference 90%+ -> realign vs full and remove primers
else
-use "as is"

Primers in bisulfite sequence
no primers
-shorter -> use as is
-longer -> set score to -1 (will be realigned at a later step)
primer swap
-scoreS > 0, rev location > fwd location -> swap primers
reverse complement (score < 0 and not blank primers)
-rc(bis.seq)
--both primers match rc -> reassign alignments
--fwd match rc, rev match -> score > 0 -> reassign alignments
conversion and alignment (score < 0)
-align bis.seq vs ref.seq -> accept if ALL score > 0
-align rc(bis.seq) vs ref.seq -> accept if ALL score > 0

mC/CG/GC identification
-all low scoring alignments, check reverse complement
-calculate difference in length between bisulfite sequence of interest and reference
-Identify in reference:
--C sites for incomplete bisulfite conversion
--CGs for methylation analysis
--GCs if NOME is enabled (1 or 2)

Plotting
-Draw one line at a time using drawmeCircles(), all rows positions are in ypos
-Calculate bisulfite conversion efficiency and identify methylation state for each site and clone
-Draw thin grey line before actual plot, grey line is showed for skipped clones
